# Skills from Comp. Appl Class
## Command Line
In  this class i learnt what the command line is. The command line gives you access to your files/ document on your computer without using GUI but rather text. And this is done with the computer's **terminal**.The command line uses special textor character such as the following; * ls * cd * pwd * man * ~ * cd .. * cd ../ and a lot more to navigate your files/folder or documents on your computer. This is an interesting and very useful computer skill to learn becaues it make your work faster. 

## GitHub
This is an interesting an interesting *web-base repository* through which you can host your project and have others contribute to it. I learnt how to **create and manage my GitHub account** as well as **use the different features ( syntax, commit, forking, readme file and wiki) in the GitHub**. I find this new knowledge very exciting and challenging and am looking forward to learning more.
